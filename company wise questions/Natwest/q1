find the sum of digits of  a numbers in a list , return answer as a list 

example

input= [43,25,67,12]
output = [7,7,13,3]

explanation:

4+3=7
2+5=7
6+7=13
1+2=3

code:

def sum_of_digits_in_list(numbers):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sums
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each number in the input list
    for num in numbers:
        # Calculate the sum of digits by converting the number to a string, then to individual integers, and summing them
        digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))
        
        # Append the result to the list
        result.append(digit_sum)
    
    return result

# Example usage:
input_numbers = [43, 25, 67, 12]
output = sum_of_digits_in_list(input_numbers)
print(output)  # Output: [7, 7, 13, 3]
